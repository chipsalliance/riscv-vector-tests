# RISC-V Vector Tests Generator

## About

This repository hosts unit tests generator for the RISC-V vector extension.

## How it works

The Spike simulator is known as the RISC-V gold standard simulator, and although we don't know how Spike is tested, it does fully support the V extension. So we added [a custom special instruction](https://github.com/ksco/riscv-vector-tests/blob/6a23892a5ab0cc72f4867cc95186b3528c99c2a0/pspike/pspike.cc#L20) to Spike, and for any test, let it automatically generate a reference result for that test. This way, we generate tests for all instructions almost automatically. Under this framework, all we have to do is write a [simple config file for each instruction](configs/).

## Prerequisite

1. `riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc` with RVV 1.0 support
2. The Spike simulator
3. Golang 1.19+
4. `riscv-pk` if you need to generate user-mode binaries

For starters, you can directly download the pre-generated tests from Github Action Artifacts.

## How to use

```
make all -j$(nproc)
```

> If you have problems compiling, please refer to the build steps in [build-and-test.yml](.github/workflows/build-and-test.yml).

After `make all`, you will find all the generated tests in `out/v[vlen]x[xlen][mode]/bin/stage2/`.

For more advanced options, run `make help`.

> Note: [single/single.go](single/single.go) generates tests directly from stage 1, suitable for targets with co-simulators (or simply use `TEST_MODE=cosim` if you're lazy).

### Nix package

This repository also provides a nix derivation with the following output provided:

- `${riscv-vector-test}/bin/*`: Generator binaries
- `${riscv-vector-test}/include/*`: Necessary headers for runtime usage
- `${riscv-vector-test}/configs/*`: Necessary runtime configs

## TODOs

- [ ] Add tests for sub-extensions (e.g. Zvamo, Zvfh)
- [ ] Support Zve64f and Zve32d
- [ ] Tail/mask agnostic support
- [ ] Fault-only-first tests
